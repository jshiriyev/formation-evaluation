Physical chemists can measure the ability of a crystal surface to adsorb water
by finding the number of sites avaiulable for ionic exchange. This is referred as
the CEC. Different materials have different CEC values. Quartz in the form of sandstone
has practically none, but illite an montmorillonite, because of their high specific (surface)
areas, have higher CEC values.

This method, while undoubtedly based on sound laboratory measurements and good petrophysical
principles, lacks one vital factor for day-to-day application-namely, the availability of CEC
values from conventional log measurements. Correlations for a given field can be made between
core measurements of CEC and other log measurements (e.g., GR, phiN, phiD). However, no practical
means exists to use this method if only well log data are available. Modifications of the Waxman-
Smits method by Juh√°sz (1979) have made it more directly applicable to measurements from logs.
